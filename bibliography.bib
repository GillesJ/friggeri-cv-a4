@article{vanheejacobs2018automaticdetection,
  abstract     = {While social media offer great communication opportunities, they also increase the vulnerability of young people to threatening situations online. Recent studies report that cyberbullying constitutes a growing problem among youngsters. Successful prevention depends on the adequate detection of potentially harmful messages and the information overload on the Web requires intelligent systems to identify potential risks automatically. The focus of this paper is on automatic cyberbullying detection in social media text by modelling posts written by bullies, victims, and bystanders of online bullying. We describe the collection and fine-grained annotation of a cyberbullying corpus for English and Dutch and perform a series of binary classification experiments to determine the feasibility of automatic cyberbullying detection. We make use of linear support vector machines exploiting a rich feature set and investigate which information sources contribute the most for the task. Experiments on a hold-out test set reveal promising results for the detection of cyberbullying-related posts. After optimisation of the hyperparameters, the classifier yields an F1 score of 64\% and 61\% for English and Dutch respectively, and considerably outperforms baseline systems.},

@misc{jacobs2015wsdtext2picto,
  abstract     = {We describe the implementation and evaluation of a word sense disambiguation (WSD) tool in a translation system that converts English text messages into sequences of pictographic images. The Text-to-Picto tool for Dutch, English, and Spanish is used on the online communication platform {\textquotedblleft}WAI-NOT{\textquotedblright} by people who have trouble reading and writing. The translation system relies on WordNets, in which synsets are populated with pictographs. In the original system, many ambiguous words are translated into an incorrect pictograph, because the pictograph is linked to the wrong word sense. The WSD method required for our translation engine must work on general domain text and use WordNet sense inventories. We opted for the gloss-overlap, extended lesk algorithm as described by Banerjee and Pedersen (2002). During translation, each possible WordNet synset of every content word in the input sentence receives a disambiguation score. This score, alongside other parameters, is used in a path-finding algorithm to determine the optimal pictograph sequence during translation. This implementation approach is easily generalised to other sense labelling algorithms, such as an SVM-based WSD tool for Dutch (Izquierdo 2015). In evaluation of the translation output, an improvement over the baseline system without WSD was not obtained. However, we found that WSD works well for ambiguous words for which sufficient pictographs are linked in our lexical-pictorial database.},
